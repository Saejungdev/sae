          <p><span>We finally</span> arrive at the gears, 
          the nerves, the mothership which 
	  oils and operates the website itself: Back-End Development. When you
	  login, or register, or make a financial transaction, or search for 
	  a model's photographs, your actions are made possible by the server
	  side of programming: the back end. Back-End Development, when 
	  combined with Front-End Development, forms Full Stack Development,
	  and the back end smoothly runs on a scripting language such as PHP
	  and a database commander such as SQL.</p> 
	  <p><span>Many database</span> languages exist, including 
          just for the SQL family
	  itself; MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, Teradata, and MonetDB, which differ
	  in syntax just as C++ and Java may differ in syntax, despite having
	  similar structures. PHP isn't the only language that can command a 
	  server, in fact, Python and C++ can also do so. If you have ever 
	  seen a website or a part of a website with a .cgi extension, you 
	  have seen a website partially or wholly powered by C++! Even Arduino
	  C can be used as a server language.</p>
	  <p><span>Sae Jung</span> has been developing 
          websites with PHP and the PDO extension
	  for over 3 years now, running on a mySQL database.</p>
