           <p><span class="firstsp">Sae Jung</span> was born 
           in the remote country of 
           South Korea. Growing up, he took an interest in computers and 
	   in web development from a young age. From the early Windows systems
	   running on floppy disks, Notepad, and Microsoft Word, Sae Jung
	   was fascinated by computers and the inner workings of software
	   in general.<br><br>
 	   <span class="firstsp">The early internet</span>
           was a fascinating world. Back in the
	   days of Geocities and Bulletin Board Systems, you could find 
	   a lot of interesting websites, from pictures of Alaska to obscure
	   microcontrollers, with the aid of Google, Yahoo, and directory
	   lists. Making and editing websites was easier than ever, and a
	   fun hobby to pass the time before this extremely interconnected
	   age. Before Facebook, Tinder, and Twitch, the most you had to 
	   connect you to the outside world was Myspace, which could have its 
	   outlook altered with HTML editing. It was a world where you could
 	   show off your coding skills by changing icons on your profile.<br> 
           <br><span class="firstsp">The Internet</span>, 
           how it works, the webpages contained within,
	   the connections made possible by it, the software that allows
	   it to run, the science behind the servers, and everything else 
	   about the online world has always fascinated Sae, and he has strived
	   to learn about it, and computer science always brings him joy.
	   <br><br>
           <span class="firstsp">Sae Jung</span> has
           been building websites since 2015. Sae started
	   on simple HTML/CSS based sites and gradually evolved to add 
	   functionality and database interaction with PHP and SQL. Using
	   an Apache web server and a mySQL database, he has experimented
	   with the back-end inner workings of web development. With jQuery
	   and CSS he has witnessed firsthand how the metaphorical HTML
	   skeleton backbone of a website can be (figuratively) brought to
	   life, adding an interactive skin and musculature of JavaScript
	   to make a website not only worth visiting, but also compelling
	   Sae to revisit again just to gawk at the beauty. If you only knew
	   how fun it is to study such a complex and mind-tickling subject,
	   who knows, maybe you too would decide to make Web Development
	   your profession.<br>
	   <p><span class="firstsp">Besides Computer Science</span>
           and related topics, Sae loves
	   exploration, architecture, and culinary topics. An avid collector
	   of pictures of buildings, scenery, foods, and fridges, Sae 
	   satisfies his craving for the world by browsing photographs
	   and collecting memorable pictures.</p>
